# Introduction
> ## Welcome to Project Anubis
### Where I die, trying to learn flutter. 
----
This repository basically contains multiple projects I will be taking up, over the course of the next few days / weeks / months / years to eventually....... master the art of flutter. 

### **Before we begin**
A few things you might want to learn / implement beforehand

- Installation of Flutter 
- Working with Dart 
- Basic concepts of Programming 

All the Projects mentioned in this Repository will be linked to a tutorial from where I have actually learned. 
*HOWEVER* if it's an app built by me, I would suggest going through the complete code first and try tto understand it yourself before simply copying the project.

---
## Also... 
Feel free to contribute,
If you have any new feature update to any of the apps, just.. go haywire and get a pull request.

PS: I will be putting all my knowledge base of flutter (notes, diagrames, tuts) into the [Wiki](https://github.com/cyph3r-exe/Project-Anubis/wiki) section. Kindly refer to that if you don't know where to start.
